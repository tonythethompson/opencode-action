# Reusable workflows

`opencode-review-threads` publishes two reusable GitHub Actions workflows under `.github/workflows`. Call them as jobs with `uses`, then pass action configuration through `with` and provider credentials through `secrets`.

The examples below pin the reusable workflow definition to a full commit SHA. Inside the called workflow, `uses: $/.` references the action at the repository root from the same repository and running commit, so the workflow reference also pins the action implementation without a second checkout or a separate action revision input.

## Manual dispatch

`opencode-bot.yml` exposes `workflow_dispatch` with the same inputs as `workflow_call`. `prompt` must be non-empty for the job to run; an empty `model` triggers the probe chains. It can be dispatched from the Actions UI or by API clients and integrations authorized to dispatch GitHub Actions workflows.

## OpenCode bot

Use `opencode-bot.yml` for `/opencode` and `/oc` comments, direct manual dispatch, or another event with a fixed `prompt`.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```yaml
---
name: OpenCode
on:
  issue_comment:
    types: [created]
  pull_request_review_comment:
    types: [created]

jobs:
  opencode:
    permissions:
      contents: read
      issues: write
      pull-requests: write
      id-token: write
      actions: read
    uses: tonythethompson/opencode-review-threads/.github/workflows/opencode-bot.yml@79a0cc2eafb6f510a2555e223445cb7e0c78b792  # v1.1.0
    with:
      model: opencode-go/kimi-k3
    secrets:
      OPENCODE_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.OPENCODE_API_KEY }}
```

For comment events, the reusable workflow accepts comments only from `OWNER`, `MEMBER`, `COLLABORATOR`, or `CONTRIBUTOR` author associations (`CONTRIBUTOR` covers org members whose private membership surfaces as `CONTRIBUTOR` in event payloads). On non-comment events, a non-empty `prompt` is required.

## Pull request review

Use `opencode-review.yml` for automatic reviews on `pull_request` events. Its `prompt` defaults to `/review-pr`.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```yaml
---
name: OpenCode review
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, reopened, synchronize, ready_for_review]

jobs:
  review:
    permissions:
      contents: read
      issues: write
      pull-requests: write
      id-token: write
      actions: read
    uses: tonythethompson/opencode-review-threads/.github/workflows/opencode-review.yml@79a0cc2eafb6f510a2555e223445cb7e0c78b792  # v1.1.0
    with:
      model: openrouter/openrouter/free
    secrets:
      OPENROUTER_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.OPENROUTER_API_KEY }}
```

This example assumes a trusted, same-repository pull request. For `pull_request` events from public forks, GitHub withholds repository Actions secrets and makes `GITHUB_TOKEN` read-only; Dependabot pull requests have the same restrictions. Private-fork behavior can differ when repository settings explicitly allow secrets or write tokens.

To focus the review, override `prompt` with a supported review aspect, for example `prompt: /review-pr security performance`. See [Pull request reviews](pull-request-reviews.md) for review behavior and security guarantees.

## Inputs

Both reusable workflows expose the action configuration plus a runner input:

Direct `workflow_dispatch` on `opencode-bot.yml` uses the same inputs.

GitHub.com's `$/path` self repository syntax resolves to the repository and commit of the workflow where it appears, including when that workflow is called from another repository. These workflows use `$/.` because the action is defined at the repository root. GitHub Enterprise Server does not support this syntax.

## Secrets

Pass only the provider secrets needed by the probe chain. The reusable workflows accept `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, `OPENCODE_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY`, `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`, `XAI_API_KEY`, `GROQ_API_KEY`, `CEREBRAS_API_KEY`, `MOONSHOT_API_KEY`, and `MISTRAL_API_KEY`. `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` and `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` enable `cf:` probe-chain entries, and `CONTEXT7_API_KEY` enables the bundled context7 MCP server. OpenCode's `cloudflare-workers-ai` provider reads `CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY` at runtime, so the workflows export that variable from `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` (a scoped Bearer token) unless `CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY` is passed explicitly.

`GH_TOKEN` is optional. When omitted, the reusable workflow falls back to the caller's `github.token`. With `use-github-token: true`, that fallback is limited to `contents: read` by the called workflow even if the caller grants `contents: write`. For code-writing operations such as `/oc fix this`, pass a separately write-scoped `GH_TOKEN`; otherwise GitHub API writes to repository contents fail with `403`.

## Permissions

The reusable workflows request `contents: read`, `pull-requests: write`, `issues: write`, `id-token: write`, and `actions: read`. A called workflow can only maintain or reduce the caller's `GITHUB_TOKEN` permissions: the caller must grant the requested permissions, but its higher `contents` permission cannot override the called workflow's `contents: read` ceiling. A separately supplied `GH_TOKEN` is not governed by that `GITHUB_TOKEN` permission ceiling.

The examples keep `permissions`, `with`, and `secrets` under the calling job so their scopes are explicit: `permissions` controls the caller token, `with` configures the reusable workflow inputs, and `secrets` passes credentials.
